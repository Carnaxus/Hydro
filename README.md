# Hydro

Pak files for the game go into - %LocalAppData%\Mining\Saved\SaveGames\Paks
Hit Win + R and copy paste %LocalAppData%\Mining\Saved\SaveGames then create the Paks folder in that directory.

# Editor
The save editor allows you to view and change all the variables in your game. There's also a few shortcut options available, such as teleporting all items from a shop into your truck, deleteing all dirt and removing pipes placed on top of each other.

Each time an edit is made a backup of the original save will be created and placed into a Backups folder in the apps directory
