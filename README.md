# Pak mods

Pak files for the game go into - %LocalAppData%\Mining\Saved\SaveGames\Paks

000-MilWaterDura_P.pak - Increases the durability of the Goliath, Ram, Harvester and Water filter to 1 million

# Editor
The save editor allows you to view and change all the variables in your game. There's also a few shortcut options available, such as teleporting all items from a shop into your truck, deleteing all dirt and removing pipes placed on top of each other.

Each time an edit is made a backup of the original save will be created and placed into a Backups folder in the apps directory
